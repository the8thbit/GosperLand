<div>This is some sort of evolutionary cellular automaton simulation thingy I've been working on for a few days. Let it run and watch as the creatures form colonies on the splotches of light spread out through the map. This is built in native web using canvas and mostly vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. jQuery is used, as well as a small perlin/simplex noise library (attribution in the perlin.js source).</div>
<div>There are a lot of features I would like to add, like for example, combat, carnivorous creatures, parasetic creatures, dead bodies/scavangers, territoriality, othering/association based on evolutionary lineage, pathfinding, sight, hiding (based on light level), display options, and state saving.</div>
<div>It could also use some optimization. For example, I do a total of 0 culling when drawing the canvas. That's a pretty low hanging fruit. Still, it runs pretty good with a grid size of 100x100. There's also no culling on the array that holds creatures. I haven't had problems with this yet, but I imagine it will eventually eat up all your memory if you let it run for long enough. (multiple hours or days)</div>

<h3>CREATURES</h3>
<ul>
    <li>At the start of every simulation the world populates with a number of randomly generated creatures in random locations. These creatures will move around the map, asexually reproduce (bud), and photosynthesize to gain energy.</li>
    <li>Creatures die if they run out of energy or if they reach their max age. Age increases by 1 every tick and can not be reduced. Energy decreases every tick, but decreases more if the creature is moving and even more if they are budding.</li>
    <li>Currently the only way to replenish energy is through photosynthesis, which occurs passively at a rate determined both by the creature's "photosynth rate" stat and the light level of the tile they are occupying.</li>
    <li>Creatures can currently do one of three things (chosen randomly, weighted by the "move freq" and "bud freq" values) on each tick: move, bud, or do nothing. Move tries to move the creature to a randomly selected tile adjacent to the creature, while bud attempts to reproduce into a randomly selected adjacent tile.</li>
    <li>Once a creature has chosen either the move or bud strategy it is locked into that strategy until it completes it, dies, or the targeted tile becomes unavailible. To complete the action the creature must fill the "action progress" value up to the level of the "difficulty" of that targeted tile. The action progress value increases at a rate equal to the "move speed" or "bud speed" values, depending on the action chosen.</li>
    <li>When a creature successfully buds, it gives slightly less than half of its current energy to its offspring. The parent keeps slightly less than half its energy, and a very small and random amount of energy is lost. (in addition to the energy loss from the bud cost and tick cost)</li>
    <li>A creature's "bud freq" and "move freq" stats are chosen, and can increase or decrease slightly in offspring</li>
    <li>A creature's "photosynth rate", "max energy", "max age", "move speed", "min bud age", "max bud age", and "bud speed" are determined by a points randomly assigned from a pool. All creatures have the same amount of points, they merely differ in terms of their allocations. When a creature buds there is a 5% chance that its offspring will have up to 5% of its points reallocated. Otherwise its point allocation will match its parent.</li>
    <li>Creatures start with a randomly assigned color. When a creature reproduces, its offspring's color will sometimes mutate slightly. Color currently has no function other than to loosely indicate a shared lineage among creatures with similar colors. Though it is possible for two creatures to spawn at the start of the simulation with a similar color, so color can't be relied on 100% to show lineage.</li>
    <li>Creatures normally have a white border around them. However, When a creature is below its minimum reproductive age, it will have a green border that will fade to white as it gets closer to its reproductive range. If a creature is above its max reproductive age its border will fade to blue until it reaches its max age. If a creature is below 20% of its max energy its border will fade to black until it reaches 0 energy.</li>
    <li>Creatures will have a white dot in their center when they are attempting to move and a black dot when they are attempting to bud.</li>
</ul>

<h3>THE MAP</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The map is composed of 100x100 colored tiles/cells with hue, saturation, and lightness corresponding to three randomly generated 2d simplex (perlin) noise maps.</li>
    <li>The hue of a tile indicates the difficulty of traversing the tile. A more red tile indicates it is difficult to traverse, while a more blue tile indicates it is easy to traverse. The higher the difficulty, the more time and energy it takes for a creature to move or bud into a target tile</li>
    <li>The saturation of a tile indicates the "advantage" of the tile. This doesn't have a function yet, but my goal is to use it as an attack/defense bonus once combat is implemented.</li>
    <li>The brightness of a tile indicates the light level of that tile. This is very important as at the moment the only way for creatures to gain energy is via photosynthesis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CONTROLS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The first row of controls are for pausing and resuming the simulation, and the second row is for changing inspect modes</li>
    <li>The [> button: resume simulation after pausing</li>
    <li>The || button: pause simulation (this can make it easier to inspect creatures)</li>
    <li>The # button: inspect terrain. Upon clicking a tile, its border will turn yellow and information about the tile will appear in the info tray</li>
    <li>The @ button: inspect creatures. Upon clicking a creature, the border of the tile it occupies will turn cyan and information about the tile will appear in the info tray</li>
    <li>Mouse: Click and drag to move the map around. Click on a tile or creature to inspect it.</li>
    <li>Other controls: You can restart the simulation by reloading your browser. To run a game with a more zoomed out view you can zoom out your browser (ctrl+- or cmd+- in most browsers) and reload the page. This can be a little buggy but is nice for getting a bigger picture of whats going on</li>
